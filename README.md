# ExpensiveMath ðŸ’¸

**ExpensiveMath is the most inefficient, unnecessary, environmentally destructive, and absurdly expensive way to do basic math!**

Are you...

- Tired of your calculator app finishing calculations in nanoseconds?
- Frustrated by the complete lack of network latency in basic arithmetic?
- Wanting to watch an infinite loop cost more than the GDP of Luxembourg?
- Needing to turn `2 + 2` into a distributed systems architecture challenge?
- Excited about the chance to break your Ruby environment on a fundamental level?

### ExpensiveMath is here to solve these problems!

Why use efficient CPU operations when you can leverage **cutting-edge AI technology** to **disrupt the status quo of basic arithmetic?** 

This isn't just math - it's **AI-powered mathematical intelligence as a service**! We're **democratizing computation** by making every addition operation a **scalable, cloud-native, machine learning experience**. 

With the power of **generative AI**, you can extend your mathematic operations runtime by over a **staggering 100 MILLION PERCENT! This is the future of math, bro - we're not just doing calculations, we're **building the next generation of intelligent computational workflows**.

Perfect for developers who think their math operations aren't nearly **expensive, slow, or carbon-intensive enough**. Finally, a way to make your calculator app require an internet connection and a monthly subscription to OpenAI!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'expensive-math'
```

And then execute:
```bash
    $ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
    $ gem install expensive-math
```

Congrats, now your Ruby core now prepared to destroy your bank account doing trivial math!

## Unintallation

**Trust me, you're going to want to do this.** Remove this line from your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'expensive-math'
```

And then execute:
```bash
    $ bundle install
```

Or uninstall it yourself as:
```bash
    $ gem uninstall expensive-math
```

You're welcome!

## Configuration

Before using ExpensiveMath, you need to configure your **[OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)**:

```ruby
require 'expensive_math'

ExpensiveMath.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
  config.api_endpoint = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions'  # default
  config.model = 'gpt-5-nano'  # default
  config.dry_run = false  # default - set to true for testing without API calls
end
```

View **[OpenAI's pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)** to choose how quickly you want to go into crippling debt.

## Usage

ExpensiveMath requires explicit activation:

```ruby
require 'expensive_math'

# Configure your API key first and turn off dry run
ExpensiveMath.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = ENV['OPENAI_API_KEY']
  config.dry_run = false
end
```

Congrats, now your math operations are going to cost you money! ðŸ’°

```
result = 2 + 3        # Makes an API call to calculate 2 + 3
puts result           # => 5 (eventually, and expensively)

# All operators are supported:
puts 10 - 4           # Subtraction via LLM
puts 6 * 7            # Multiplication via LLM  
puts 15 / 3           # Division via LLM
puts 2 ** 8           # Exponentiation via LLM
puts 17 % 5           # Modulo via LLM
puts 5 == 5           # Equality comparison via LLM
puts 3 < 7            # Less than comparison via LLM
puts 8 > 2            # Greater than comparison via LLM
puts 4 <= 4           # Less than or equal via LLM
puts 9 >= 6           # Greater than or equal via LLM
puts 5 <=> 3          # Spaceship operator via LLM
```

See the [Dry Run Mode](#dry-run-mode) section for more information if you want to preview the cost and performance impact of your math operations without actually making API calls or requiring an API key.

### Safely testing locally

The "safest" way to run this is in dry mode inside of an irb session. This way you can test the gem without actually making API calls or requiring an API key. Note that the gem is _immediately_ bootstrapped meaning even the act of loading Ruby will use the overriden operators.

```shell
EXPENSIVE_MATH_ENABLED=true irb -I lib -r expensive_math
```


### Safety Features

- **Opt-in activation**: Simply requiring the gem won't break your Ruby environment
- **Dry run mode**: Preview how awful this gem is before you pay for it
- **Graceful fallback**: If API calls fail, operations fall back to normal CPU calculations
- **No API key required**: Without an API key, all operations use normal Ruby math

### Dry Run Mode

For testing purposes, you can enable dry run mode to see what operations would be sent to the LLM without actually making API calls or requiring an API key:

```ruby
require 'expensive_math'

# Configure dry run mode (no API key needed!)
ExpensiveMath.configure do |config|
  config.dry_run = true
  config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)  # Optional: see dry run logs
end

# Enable expensive math
ExpensiveMath.enable!

# Operations will log what they would do but use normal Ruby math
puts 2 + 3  # Logs: "DRY RUN: Would ask AI to calculate 2 + 3" â†’ 5
puts 10 * 5 # Logs: "DRY RUN: Would ask AI to calculate 10 * 5" â†’ 50

# Check dry run status
puts ExpensiveMath.dry_run?  # => true
```

**Dry run features:**
- âœ… Works only when ExpensiveMath is enabled
- âœ… No API key required
- âœ… Logs intended operations for debugging
- âœ… Returns correct mathematical results using normal Ruby operations
- âœ… Perfect for testing integration without API costs

### Estimation Rake Task

ExpensiveMath includes a convenient rake task for estimating the cost and performance impact of mathematical expressions without actually making API calls:

#### Single Expression Analysis

```bash
rake expensive_math:estimate['2 + 3 * 4']
```

This will output detailed analysis including:
- Operation count detection
- Estimated API cost
- Estimated execution time
- Performance comparison with regular Ruby

#### Multiple Expression Analysis

You can analyze multiple expressions at once using semicolon delimiters:

#### Simple Expression
```bash
rake expensive_math:estimate['2 + 3']
```

**Output:**
```
Processing 1 expressions: ["2 + 3"]
ðŸ“Š Comparison Table:
| Expression | Operations | Regular Ruby | ExpensiveMath | Time Increase | Cost |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------|
| 2 + 3      | 1          | 0.0029ms     | 1820ms        | 62,658,517%   | $0.000002 |
```

#### Multiple Moderate Expressions
```bash
rake expensive_math:estimate['5 * 7 - 1; (10 / 2) + 3; 2 ** 3 % 5']
```

**Output:**
```
Processing 3 expressions: ["5 * 7 - 1", "(10 / 2) + 3", "2 ** 3 % 5"]
ðŸ“Š Comparison Table:
| Expression | Operations | Regular Ruby | ExpensiveMath | Time Increase | Cost |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------|
| 5 * 7 - 1  | 2          | 0.0035ms     | 3640ms        | 103,957,043%  | $0.000004 |
| (10 / 2) + 3 | 2          | 0.0041ms     | 3728ms        | 90,926,729%   | $0.000004 |
| 2 ** 3 % 5 | 3          | 0.0058ms     | 5547ms        | 95,637,831%   | $0.000006 |
```

#### Complex Expressions with Comparisons
```bash
rake expensive_math:estimate['(2 + 3) * 4 != 20; 10 / 2 + 3 * 4 >= 17; (5 ** 2 - 10) <= (3 + 4) * 2']
```

**Output:**
```
Processing 3 expressions: ["(2 + 3) * 4 != 20", "10 / 2 + 3 * 4 >= 17", "(5 ** 2 - 10) <= (3 + 4) * 2"]
ðŸ“Š Comparison Table:
| Expression | Operations | Regular Ruby | ExpensiveMath | Time Increase | Cost |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------|
| (2 + 3) * 4 !... | 3          | 0.0038ms     | 5547ms        | 145,973,584%  | $0.000006 |
| 10 / 2 + 3 * ... | 4          | 0.0046ms     | 5472ms        | 118,956,422%  | $0.000008 |
| (5 ** 2 - 10)... | 5          | 0.006ms      | 4140ms        | 68,999,900%   | $0.00001 |
```

**Key Observations:**
- Each operation costs ~$0.000002
- Regular Ruby operations execute in microseconds (0.003-0.006ms)
- ExpensiveMath operations take thousands of milliseconds (3-6 seconds each)
- Time increases range from 69 million% to 146 million% slower than regular Ruby
- Inequality operators like `!=` leverage the expensive `==` implementation
- Complex expressions with 5+ operations can cost over $0.00001 per calculation

The rake task automatically runs in dry run mode, so no API key is required and no actual API calls are made.

## Features

- âœ… Replaces all basic mathematical operators with LLM API calls
- âœ… Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo
- âœ… Supports comparison operators
- âœ… Works with integers, floats, rationals, and complex numbers
- âœ… Configurable LLM endpoint and model
- âœ… Dry run mode for testing without API calls or costs
- âœ… Guaranteed to be slower and more expensive than regular math
- âœ… Perfect for burning through your API quota
- âœ… Might cost you your job

## Why?

Great question! Here are some compelling reasons to use ExpensiveMath:

1. **Cost Optimization**: Why spend $0.00 on CPU cycles when you can spend $0.002 per calculation?
2. **Latency Enhancement**: Transform microsecond operations into multi-second adventures
3. **Carbon Footprint Maximization**: Ensure your simple arithmetic contributes to global warming
4. **Dependency Injection**: Add network dependencies to the most basic operations
5. **Debugging Complexity**: Turn `2 + 2 = 4` into a distributed systems problem
6. **Rate Limiting Fun**: Experience the joy of being throttled while calculating your grocery bill

## Error Handling

ExpensiveMath automatically handles failures gracefully to ensure your application continues running (albeit expensively):

1. **Built-in Retry Logic**: Each operator includes exponential backoff retry mechanisms that attempt the LLM call multiple times, maximizing both latency and API costs before giving up.

2. **Automatic Fallback**: When LLM calls fail after retries, operations automatically fall back to the original Ruby math operators that were preserved during monkey patching. This ensures your app doesn't crash - it just continues being brutally slow and expensive.

3. **Transparent Recovery**: The fallback happens seamlessly within each operator call, so your code continues executing without manual error handling. You get the "best" of both worlds: maximum inefficiency when possible, basic functionality when necessary.
